- Using flex-grow in main div container
I Wanted to allow the container to grow and take up any available vertical space within its parent container. Basically it's what makes the card expand to fill the entire screen height. It will also be pushing the pagination controls all the way to the bottom.

- Added a documentation directory
it includes File and Directory Breakdown
